Also includes a chat command to toggle both: /dwons.\n\nIdea by Ghost.\n\n[04-05-19] Now warns in chat if Spawn Tweaks options are customised. Added option to enable Dwons on boot.\n[27-04-19] Added vertical mode. Added syncing state to clients, the UI will now correctly display the state of Deathwish and Onslaught whether you are host or client.\n[24-04-19] Because state isn't currently synced the message will now be disabled while you're not the host\n[22-04-19] Adding a /dwons chat command which toggles both Deathwish & Onslaught. Added a font size option for the HUD text which can be set to 0 if you don't want to see it.";
